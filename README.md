# ServoMotor



This project demonstrates how to control four servo motors using an Arduino UNO. The servos are programmed to move one after another in a sweeping motion from 0° to 180° and back to 0°, each with a different speed (delay).

The setup can be used as a basic motion sequence for robotic arms or joint
